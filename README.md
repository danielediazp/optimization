# Profiling Daniel Diaz

- The most time-consuming aspect of my final UM was the search
for an allocator capable of reducing memory allocation time 
throughout the program. Analyzing the flame graph made it 
evident that this particular task accounted for the majority 
of the code execution time. While examining the assembly code, 
I couldn't pinpoint any specific areas for potential improvement. 
However, I acknowledge the option of optimizing the code through 
the use of hard-coded jumps, although I perceive this approach as 
a more challenging strategy.


- I spent around 10 hours combined working on both analyzing and 
solving the problem.
